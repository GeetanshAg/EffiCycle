Efficycle Project ðŸš´âš¡
This repository showcases our Efficycle project, where we designed and built a three-wheeled, human-electric hybrid vehicle as part of an intercollegiate competition. I had the privilege of leading the project as the Team Captain, coordinating design, simulation, manufacturing, and testing activities.

What's Inside
CAD Models: 3D designs of the vehicle structure and components
CAE Reports: Structural and performance analysis results
Video Demonstration: A highlight of our prototype in action
Project Timeline: Key milestones documenting our journey from concept to prototype

Highlights of the Project
Led a team of students to design and fabricate a lightweight 3-wheeled hybrid vehicle.
Performed design optimization using CAD and CAE tools.
Conducted testing and performance evaluation of the prototype.
Oversaw documentation and presentation for competition standards.

Project Timeline
We structured the effort into phases:
Research and Conceptualization â€“ studied vehicle dynamics, ergonomics, and energy efficiency.
Design Phase â€“ CAD modeling of chassis and major assemblies.
CAE Simulations â€“ FEA and motion analysis for strength and safety.
Fabrication â€“ manufacturing of the chassis and assembly of the drivetrain.
Testing & Validation â€“ track tests, performance evaluation, and data collection.
Final Presentation & Demonstration â€“ video documentation and reporting.
